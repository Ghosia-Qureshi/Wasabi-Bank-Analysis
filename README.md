## Getting Started

Data Gathering: Gathered the ATM and customer-related data of Wisabi Bank from an online source. 
Data Importing: The collected data is imported into the MYSQL Workbench for further analysis.
Processing: The imported data is organized by creating tables and relations between the tables and ensures data integrity. Then some of the field needs to be transformed for the feasible analysis like data and time columns format. The dataset was large so for better performance, a view table named “combined table” was created to append the data of all five transaction tables in one table to write the optimized query.
Insights: The insights are performed after analysis and some recommendations according to the insights.
Objective:
Analyze ATM transactions and customer behavior to identify patterns, trends, and insights for optimizing banking services and customer experience.
